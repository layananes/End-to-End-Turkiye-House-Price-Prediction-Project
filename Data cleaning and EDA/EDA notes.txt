#These are some general notes after my EDA observation!

We have a total of 14 columns

###Column Means:

**1.** Net area: 127.37
**2.** Gross area: 151.45
**3.** Room count: 3.69
**4.** Total building floors: 5.22
**5.** Bathroom count: 1.47
**6.** Price : 3,035,337

###The rest are categorical so I will describe in terms of mode, not mean.

**7.** Floor : 5406 2nd floors
**8.** Furnished status: 10871 empty 
**9.** Building age: 6019 new
**10.** Heating type: 11792 kombi natural gas 
**11.** City: mode is 1433 (diyarbakir), though 6 cities are almost equally distributed:

diyarbakir        1433
adana             1416
denizli           1401
gaziantep         1387
antalya           1368
kocaeli           1298

**12.** Occupancy status: 12083 empty
**13** Investment_Eligibility: 13318 unknown 
**14.** Title deed status: 10171 unknown 10739

-------------------------------------------------

I noticed that some columns have "unknown" and "bilinmiyor", so I merged both to avoid confusion in further steps when model training. 

- I observed strong correlation of price with room count, bathroom count, net area, and gross area (evident through
  corrrelation matrix). 

- For heating type and building age, it was a little trickier since they are categorical data,
  but through filtering I am confident that I can see a positive correlation, where older houses or those with worse
  heating are generally the same in price as small houses which are significantly smaller or have good heating types. 

- I am still unsure about floor location, since I saw a strong correlation in the correlation matrix and through 
  pearson correlation, but was unable to observe it through box plots and general filters. 

- For heating type and building age, I was thinking of encoding them with ordinal encoding since some categories are 
  less desirable. The same could be said about room and bathroom count, though I think we can also use label encoding
  since they are numerical

- Title_Deed_Status, Furnished_Status, and Investment_Eligibility have large amounts of unknown data which poses an issue.
  Furnished_status is also unreliable, since furnished houses showed LOWER price. 

- Columns I think we should consider dropping are total building floors and furnished status, since I do not see a logical
  correlation between them and price.


**Important note:** Houses in Istanbul and Aydin seemed to be the most expensive. However, only 7 houses from 
                    istanbul and 57 houses from Aydin can be found throughout the entire dataset. I'm unsure 
                    but I suspect that they could affect the model training and might lead to incorrect 
                    predicitons about house prices in both Istanbul and Aydin
